# pytudes

Inspired by [Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), this project contains miscellaneous Python programs.

I’ve been a hobbyist programmer for over 10 years, and I’ve flirted with Python on and off. I remember a time when Ruby was a lot popular, and I was still a strong advocate. The data science trend means that it’s not cool to like Python anymore, but Pepperidge Farm still remembers.

This project is to solidify my Python knowledge once and for all. It will also serve as documentation for my future self.
